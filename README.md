It is also known by its common name, the rose (scientific name: Rosa damascena), a famous plant species in the Rosaceae family. This name is given in the West because the West knew it during its campaigns against the Levant, and not because the origin of this species is from the Levant, so because it is a hybrid plant and not wild. Essential to his examination is that this type results from the hybridization of three types of roses: the musky rose, the French rose, and the Fedtschenkoana rose (in Latin: Rosa fedtschenkoana) from Central Asia, meaning that it has no original homeland, and the place where it was hybridized is not known specifically.
